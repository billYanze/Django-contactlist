## Purpose:
learn how to use Django and cooperate with Python to build background management.

### Task:
Using django to implement the contact manager

### URL: 
Ater docker-compose up, this app can only run on http://localhost:8000/ now
I will change to http://localhost:8080/ for next exercise.

### In addition:

I think I clear the database, there will be no contact list on the homepage and need to create the new person to test by clicking add a new contact.

Thank you!


And for exercise8, I just see I have a small mistakes, I am really sorry. I forget to change the name of the folder in the path. Hence, the code in tag e8submission maybe not work, I update the Dockerfile-devel file, but I know it's too late, sorry!
